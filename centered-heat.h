# Incompressible Navier--Stokes solver (centered formulation)

We wish to approximate numerically the incompressible,
variable-density Navier--Stokes equations
$$
\partial_t\mathbf{u}+\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{u}) =
\frac{1}{\rho}\left[-\nabla p + \nabla\cdot(2\mu\mathbf{D})\right] +
\mathbf{a}
$$
$$
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = 0
$$
with the deformation tensor
$\mathbf{D}=[\nabla\mathbf{u} + (\nabla\mathbf{u})^T]/2$.

The scheme implemented here is close to that used in Gerris ([Popinet,
2003](/src/references.bib#popinet2003), [Popinet,
2009](/src/references.bib#popinet2009), [LagrÃ©e et al,
2011](/src/references.bib#lagree2011)).

We will use the generic time loop, a CFL-limited timestep, the
Bell-Collela-Glaz advection scheme and the implicit viscosity
solver.
There are 2 ways of solid treatment: (i) embedded boundaries method (EBM), (ii) Brinkman Penalization method (BPM).
If embedded boundaries are used, a different scheme is used for viscosity.
The advantages of EBM are high accuracy and MPI parallelization, however, it works only for \textbf{one phase flow}.
If Brinkman Penalization method for solid treatment is used,
then a penalization term is added implicitly with the viscous term.
In this case $\mathbf{a} = -\frac{\chi}{\eta_s}\left(\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{U_t} \right)$
BPM can work for multiphase flow with MPI parallelization with sufficient accuracy.
Detailed information about comparison you can find here.
